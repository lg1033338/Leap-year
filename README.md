Leap Year Checker 💻✨

This is a simple C# console program that asks the user for a year and tells them whether it is a leap year or not.

📖 How It Works

The program asks the user:

Please give a year darling:


It checks the year against leap year rules:

If divisible by 400 → leap year

Else if divisible by 100 → not a leap year

Else if divisible by 4 → leap year

Otherwise → not a leap year

It prints a fun message back, like:

That year is a leap year darling <3


or

That is no leap year darling!

Arigato gozamashita 🙏
